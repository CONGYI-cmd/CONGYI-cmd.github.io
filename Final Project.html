                Trash can robot in Disneyland
            </h6>
            <p>
                I still remember when I first went to Disneyland, there was a trash can robot which can talk,<br>
                 move, and open & close automatically. I always want to have something like that at home. <br>
                 Therefore, for this project, I would like to design and implement one by myself. My trash can robot<br>
                  will use an arduino and several electronic components to support its functionalities. When <br>
                  it knows someone is nearby, the robot would be activated and start “talking” with the person.<br>
<br/>
Here is a video shows how the trash can robot interacts with people in Disneyland:<br>

<br/>
If time allowed: add LED strips and use the strips to show the robot’s emotion. The LED will change color and flash corresponding to the content on the LCD.<br> 

            <h4>
                Anticipated Bill of Materials:  
            </h4>
            <p>
                Arduino (for running the firmware)<br>
                Breadboard (for implementing the circuit)<br>
                Ultrasonic Sensor (for sensing the object in front of the robot)<br>
                Servo Motor (to open & close the lid automatically)<br>
                LCD (for showing texts to users)<br>
                LED Strips (if I have time, for showing the emotion of the robot with color)<br>

            </p>
            <h4>
                Timeline:
            </h4>
            <p>
                By March 1, prepare all the materials, finish the prototype design<br>
March 1 to March 5, build the circuit and implement the code<br>
March 5 to March 8, debug and optimize the product. (Add the LED strip to the robot if time allowed)<br>

            </p>
            <h4>
                Contingency Plans:

            </h4>
            <p>
                If the Ultrasonic Sensor is not able to sense the object in the front, I will use a motion sensor.<br>
If the plastic trash can is too difficult to add electric components on it, I will use a paper box.<br>
