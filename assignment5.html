            <h1>Congyi's Assignment 5!</h1>
            <p>
                This assignment contains a schematic, circuit, and code that uses a transistor to control load power separate from logic power. I used analogWrite(), a high-load output device, and an input sensor that uses a library. <br>
                <br>
            Components in the circuit:<br>
            &emsp;1 DC motor<br>
            &emsp;1 Flyback diode<br>
            &emsp;1 Keypad<br>
            &emsp;1 N-MOSFET transistor<br>
            &emsp;Several wires<br>
            </p>
            <h4>
                Schematic:

            <h4>
                Calcuation:
            </h4>
            <p>
                Arrcoding to the Motor Datasheet https://www.arduino.cc/documents/datasheets/DCmotor.PDF, the current is 90mA when the operating voltage is 6.0V DC. In my circuit, I used a 12V power which is 2 times 6.0V DC, so the min current can be assumed as 180mA.<br>
                The max current would be 3.2A * 2 = 6.4A. The value is much smaller than the drain current of the trasistor (32A). So the circuit is safe to opearte.<br>
                The flyback diode was added to aviod sudden voltage spikes. <br>
            </p>
            <h4>
                Circuit:
            </h4>

            </p>
            <p>
                The circuit was implemented on my breadboard. The keypad is attached to pin 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. The motor is powered by 12V power supply.<br> 
                The G terminal of the transistor is connected to pin 9. Its D termianl is linked with the moter and the S terminal is connected to the ground.<br> 
            <p>
                What's more, the input keys will be printed in the serial monitor to give users a reference. 
            </p>

            <h4>
            
                Firmware:<br>
                The program contains one keypad as input and DC motor as output<br>
                It will print those input for giving a reference. 2 input keys will count as a new speed for the motor to spin.<br>
                With the help of transistor, the system will gradually speed up to reach the set speed and then slow down to 0 speed.<br>
